<h3> Note for prospective students </h3>

Dr. Chetan Arora is an Associate Professor and a Pankaj Gupta Young Faculty Fellow in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Delhi. My current research interests includes following:
<ol>
	<li><b>Trusworthy AI:</b> I am interested in making modern computer vision systems using machine learning techniques more trustworthy. Specific topics of interest include Adversarial attack and defense techniques, Reliability, Causality and Fairness. </li>
	<li><b>Cancer Detection:</b> Computer aided detection models for detecting cancer, and trained on western population are not successful for Indian population. We would like to develop models specifically for Indian population. Our current focus is on Breast Cancer detection from Mammograms, and Gall Bladder Cancer from Ultrsound images. </li>
	<li><b>Mobility:</b> I am interested in developing computer vision techniques for driving assistance and autonomous driving systems in the Indian context. The topics of interest include learning from small number of samples using Active Learning, Domain Adaptation, or Self Supervised Learning. We are also interested in learning models with geometric or algorithmic priors for improved generalization in unseen scenarios. </li>
	<li><b>Egocentric Vision:</b> I am interested in novel computer vision applications arising out of body worn egocentric cameras. We are specifically interested in developing techniques to understand the wearer attributes, and his social life from daylong egocentric videos. </li>
	<li><b>Social Impact:</b> I am on constant lookout to use my expertise for applications with social impact. My current interest includes developing camera based wearable device as mobility assistant for visually impaired. </li>
</ol>
