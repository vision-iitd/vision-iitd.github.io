We are looking for technically strong, and committed students interested to do a PhD/ MS(R) in computer vision and machine learning. Interested students may look at our publications and project pages to get a glimpse of ongoing work. Note that, applicants must go through the official IITD admission process.

<h4 id="research-assistant-positions">Research Assistant Positions</h4>
We have a few research assistant positions vacant in a couple of projects. Students who have completed their bachelor&#39;s degree, or in their final year, and are looking for a one year or longer paid assistantship can write to Dr. Arora with their resume, and transcripts. Please note that the positions are for full time only, and you will need to be physically present in the IITD campus for this. You must have strong understanding of computer vision as well as machine learning for these positions.
<br/>

<h4 id="for-undergraduate-students">For Undergraduate Students</h4>
We usually do not take students for any short term projects, no winter or summer internships. Please contact Dr. Arora only if you have exceptional academic credentials and are interested in a year long project. All the projects are to be done onsite only and not remotely. IIT Delhi students with a 8+ CGPA may contact Dr. Arora for a minor project, COD300, BTP or an MTP. Dr. Arora does not work with IIT students without a credited course with him.
