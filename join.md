Please contact Dr. Arora only if you have exceptional academic credentials and are interested in a year long project. All the projects are to be done onsite only and not remotely. IIT Delhi students with a 8+ CGPA may contact Dr. Arora for a minor project, COD300, BTP or an MTP. Dr. Arora does not work with IIT students without a credited course with him.
